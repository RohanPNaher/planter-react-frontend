The idea behind this app came from my nickname of "House Plant Reaper". I love caring for plants, but I also have to unfortunate tendency of killing plants by drenching their soil and eventually killing their roots. This app is designed to help you keep track of your plants watering schedule so that you don't overwater and kill your plants that way over again.
